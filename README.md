# Face_recognition_System-using-OpenCV-and-Python
This project is a real-time face recognition system built using Python and OpenCV. It captures faces through a webcam, trains a model using the LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) algorithm, and recognizes faces in live video streams. The system is designed to be easy to set up and extend for multiple users.
